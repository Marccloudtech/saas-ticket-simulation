🧪 **SaaS Support Simulation – Preview (ClarityFlow Mastery Portfolio)**  
Empathy · Communication · Language · Growth · Instructional Design · Bilingual EN/FR · QA & Version Control  

---

This project simulates a real-life SaaS support ticket handled through a tool like Zendesk. It includes:  

- A sample customer support request  
- An internal note showing how I’d think through and resolve the issue  
- A sample customer-facing response  
- Bonus: folder structure and example screenshots

### 🎯 Scenario: Password Reset Fails with "Invalid Token"

**Customer’s Message (via Zendesk):**  
> “Hi, I’m trying to reset my password but your system keeps giving me an ‘Invalid Token’ error. Can you help?”

---

### 🧠 Internal Notes (for team only)  
Steps I would take before replying to the customer:  

✅ Search customer email in our database  
🔍 Check if token is expired (they often expire within 15–60 mins)  
🔁 If expired, manually trigger a new password reset link  
🛠 Log error to dev team if it appears to be a recurring issue  
📝 Document everything internally  

👉 See folder: `internal_notes/zendesk_internal_note_01.md`  

---

### 💬 Customer-Facing Reply  
**Tone:** calm, supportive, and professional  
**Goal:** reassure the customer and resolve the issue clearly  

👉 See folder: `customer_responses/zendesk_customer_reply_01.md`

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack + Tools Simulated  
📨 Zendesk (ticketing)  
🗂 Internal documentation (Notion-style notes)  
🧠 Soft Skills: calm under pressure, clear writing, empathy, step-by-step thinking  

---

### 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates  
- Real-world customer support communication (English + French)  
- Simulated Zendesk-style support ticket handling  
- Internal troubleshooting documentation  
- Professional, bilingual customer-facing replies  
- GitHub project organization and commit hygiene  

---

### 💼 Portfolio Relevance  
This simulation is designed to mirror a real-life SaaS customer support role using tools like Zendesk or Intercom.  

It demonstrates my ability to:  
- Write clear and empathetic support responses  
- Document technical troubleshooting steps  
- Communicate professionally in both English and French  
- Stay calm under pressure while resolving issues remotely  

---

### 🔄 Lessons Learned / Reflection  
- Simulating customer support builds confidence under real-world pressure  
- Clear internal notes prevent confusion during team handoffs  
- Customers don’t just want fixes — they want **clarity and care**  

---

### 📄 Buyer Persona vs. ICP – Internal Support Note  
📄 Additional learning resource:  
Explore how SaaS teams define and use **Buyer Personas** and **Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)** to improve support and communication.  

👉 See: `buyer-persona-vs-icp.md`

### 🙋‍♂️ About Me  
I’m Marc, a **bilingual (EN/FR) Instructional Designer & Content Creator** specializing in SaaS training systems.  

I build simulations like this one to:  
- Demonstrate how technical workflows (internal notes, escalations, customer replies) can be turned into **job-ready training materials**  
- Showcase **bilingual communication** (English + French) in real support contexts  
- Apply **instructional design frameworks** (clarity, QA, consistency) to SaaS scenarios  

📌 This project is a **preview** from my *ClarityFlow Mastery course* and *Instructional Design Companion Bible*.  
It is not the full course — only selected examples are shown here as portfolio pieces.  

---

### 💼 Portfolio Context  
This simulation demonstrates my ability to design **instructional workflows** around SaaS support scenarios.  
More simulations and structured modules will be published soon as part of my **ClarityFlow Mastery course**.
