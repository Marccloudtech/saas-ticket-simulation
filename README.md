This project simulates a real-life SaaS support ticket handled through a tool like Zendesk. It includes:

- A sample **customer support request**
- An **internal note** showing how I’d think through and resolve the issue
- A sample **customer-facing response**
- Bonus: folder structure and example screenshots

## 🎯 Scenario: Password Reset Fails with "Invalid Token"

**Customer's Message (via Zendesk):**
> “Hi, I’m trying to reset my password but your system keeps giving me an ‘Invalid Token’ error. Can you help?”

---

## 🧠 Internal Notes (for team only)

**Steps I would take before replying to the customer:**

1. ✅ Search customer email in our database
2. 🔍 Check if token is expired (they often expire within 15–60 mins)
3. 🔁 If expired, manually trigger a new password reset link
4. 🛠 Log error to dev team if it appears to be a recurring issue
5. 📝 Document everything internally

See folder: `internal_notes/zendesk_internal_note_01.md`

---

## 💬 Customer-Facing Reply

**Tone:** Calm, supportive, and professional  
**Goal:** Reassure the customer and resolve the issue clearly

See folder: `customer_responses/zendesk_customer_reply_01.md`

---

## 💼 Job Readiness Relevance

This simulation is designed to mirror a real-life SaaS customer support role using tools like Zendesk or Intercom.

It demonstrates my ability to:
- Write clear and empathetic support responses
- Document technical troubleshooting steps
- Communicate professionally in both English and French
- Stay calm under pressure while resolving issues remotely

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me  
I'm Marc, a bilingual (EN/FR) **Instructional Designer & Content Creator** specializing in SaaS training systems.  

I build simulations like this one to:  
- Demonstrate how technical workflows (internal notes, escalations, customer replies) can be turned into **job-ready training materials**.  
- Showcase **bilingual communication** (English + French) in real support contexts.  
- Apply **instructional design frameworks** (clarity, QA, consistency) to SaaS scenarios.  

📌 This project is a **preview** from my ClarityFlow Mastery course and Instructional Design Companion Bible.  
It’s not the full course — only selected examples are shown here as portfolio pieces.


💼 Portfolio Context  
This simulation demonstrates my ability to design **instructional workflows** around SaaS support scenarios.  
More simulations and structured modules will be published soon as part of my ClarityFlow Mastery course.
