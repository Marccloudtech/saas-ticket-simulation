This project simulates a real-life SaaS support ticket handled through a tool like Zendesk. It includes:

- A sample **customer support request**
- An **internal note** showing how I’d think through and resolve the issue
- A sample **customer-facing response**
- Bonus: folder structure and example screenshots

## 🎯 Scenario: Password Reset Fails with "Invalid Token"

**Customer's Message (via Zendesk):**
> “Hi, I’m trying to reset my password but your system keeps giving me an ‘Invalid Token’ error. Can you help?”

---

## 🧠 Internal Notes (for team only)

**Steps I would take before replying to the customer:**

1. ✅ Search customer email in our database
2. 🔍 Check if token is expired (they often expire within 15–60 mins)
3. 🔁 If expired, manually trigger a new password reset link
4. 🛠 Log error to dev team if it appears to be a recurring issue
5. 📝 Document everything internally

See folder: `internal_notes/zendesk_internal_note_01.md`

---

## 💬 Customer-Facing Reply

**Tone:** Calm, supportive, and professional  
**Goal:** Reassure the customer and resolve the issue clearly

See folder: `customer_responses/zendesk_customer_reply_01.md`
