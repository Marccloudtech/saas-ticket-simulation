# ðŸ’¬ Customer-Facing Reply â€“ Password Reset Issue

Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out â€” and Iâ€™m sorry for the trouble with the password reset link.

It looks like the link may have expired (theyâ€™re time-sensitive for security reasons). Iâ€™ve just sent you a fresh reset link â€” it should arrive in your inbox shortly. Please try using the new one right away.

If it still doesnâ€™t work, let me know and Iâ€™ll personally take care of it with our technical team.

Thanks again for your patience,  
Marc Maisonneuve
